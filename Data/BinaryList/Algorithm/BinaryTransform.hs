Given a bijection @f :: a -> b@, with inverse @f' :: b -> a@, and a functor @c@,
we can build a bijection @g :: c a -> c b@. Namely: @g = fmap f@.

** Proof

Let @f :: a -> b@ be a bijection with inverse @f' :: b -> a@. Let @c@ be a functor.
Define @g = fmap f@.

* Injectivity:
     Let @v, w :: c a@ such that @g(v) = g(w)@
  by definition of g
     => fmap f v = fmap f w
  applying @fmap f'@ to both sides
     => fmap f' (fmap f v) = fmap f' (fmap f w)
  by functor law
     => fmap (f' . f) v = fmap (f' . f) w
  since f' is the inverse of f
     => fmap id v = fmap id w
  by functor law
     => v = w

* Surjectivity:
     Let @w :: c b@.
     Define @v = fmap f' w@.
     => g(v) = g (fmap f' w)
  by definition of @g@
     => g(v) = fmap f (fmap f' w)
  by functor law
     => g(v) = fmap (f . f') w
  since f' is the inverse of f
     => g(v) = fmap id w
  by functor law
     => g(v) = w

Therefore, @g :: c a -> c b@ is a bijection. Its inverse is @g' = fmap f'@. Indeed:

* Left inverse:
     Let @v :: c a@.
     => g' (g v)
  by definition of g and g'
      = fmap f' (fmap f v)
  by functor law
      = fmap (f' . f) v
  since f' is the inverse of f
      = fmap id v
  by functor law
      = v

* Right inverse:
     Let @w :: c b@.
     => g (g' w)
  by definition of g and g'
      = fmap f (fmap f' w)
  by functor law
      = fmap (f . f') w
  since f' is the inverse of f
      = fmap id w
  by functor law
      = w

-- Product Bijection

{-# INLINE productBijection #-}

-- | The product of two bijections. This is the equivalent to '***' for the 'Bijection' type.
productBijection :: Bijection a b -> Bijection c d -> Bijection (a,c) (b,d)
productBijection (Bijection f f') (Bijection g g') = Bijection (f *** g) (f' *** g')

{-

Let @f :: a -> b@ be a bijection with inverse @f' :: b -> a@.
Let @g :: c -> d@ be a bijection with inverse @g' :: d -> c@.
Define @h = f *** g@. Then @h :: (a,c) -> (b,d)@ is a bijection.

** Proof

* Injectivity:
     Let @p, q :: (a,c)@ such that @h(p) = h(q)@
  by definition of h
     => (f *** g) p = (f *** g) q
  making explicit that @p@ and @q@ are pairs
     => (f *** g) (p1,p2) = (f *** g) (q1,q2)
  by definition of (***)
     => (f p1, g p2) = (f q1, g q2)
  by pair equality
     => f p1 = f q1 AND g p2 = g q2
  by injectivy of f and g
     => p1 = q1 AND p2 = q2
  since p = (p1,p2) AND q = (q1,q2)
     => p = q

* Surjectivity:
     Let @q :: (b,d)@.
  making explicit that @q@ is a pair
     => q = (q1,q2)
        Define p = (f' q1, g' q2)
  by definition of h
     => h(p) = (f *** g) p
  by definition of p
     => h(p) = (f *** g) (f' q1, g' q2)
  by definition of (***)
     => h(p) = (f (f' q1), g (g' q2))
  since f' is the inverse of f, and g' is the inverse of g
     => h(p) = (q1,q2)
  since q = (q1,q2)
     => h(p) = q

Therefore, @h :: (a,c) -> (b,d)@ is a bijection. Its inverse is
@h' = f' *** g'@. Indeed:

* Left inverse:
     Let @p :: (a,c)@.
     => h' (h p)
  making explicit that @p@ is a pair
      = h' (h (p1,p2))
  by definition of h
      = h' (f p1, g p2)
  by definition of h'
      = (f' (f p1), g' (g p2))
  since f' is the inverse of f, and g' is the inverse of g
      = (p1, p2)
  since p = (p1,p2)
      = p

* Right inverse:
     Let @q :: (b,d)@.
     => h (h' q)
  making explicit that @q@ is a pair
      = h (h' (q1,q2))
  by definition of h'
      = h (f' q1, g' q2)
  by definition of h
      = (f (f' q1), g (g' q2))
  since f' is the inverse of f, and g' is the inverse of g
      = (q1, q2)
  since q = (q1,q2)
      = q
